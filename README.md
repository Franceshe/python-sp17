## Python Workshops
##### [Computational Science and Engineering](http://cse.illinois.edu/)

### Foreword

Python is a popular scripting language which can support numerical computing, machine learning, , and more.  This workshop series will introduce you to basic and advanced Python modules and concepts.

The EWS Linux machines have everything we need for the workshop.  If you plan to use your personal laptop, you'll need to install a version of Python 3 like [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).


### Location

All workshops will be held in the EWS computer laboratory, [L520](http://ada.fs.illinois.edu/0210PLANB.html) [Digital Computer Laboratory](http://ada.fs.illinois.edu/0210.html).

**There is no sign-up for this series—walk-ins are welcome and encouraged!**

L520 DCL can be a little tricky to find if you haven't been there before. It's located in the basement, and can be accessed by going down the main staircase in DCL and turning right.


### Topics

#### Introduction to Python

**Feb. 14, 1:00 p.m.–3:00 p.m.**

Open a new Terminal (command line) and run the setup code below to prepare your EWS machine to run our Python lesson today. This will download the data we will work with a Jupyter Notebook. (You can copy and paste the entire block at once.)

```
source /class/cs101/etc/venv/cse/bin/activate /class/cs101/etc/venv/cse/
cd
cd Documents
git clone https://github.com/uiuc-cse/python-sp17.git
cd python-sp17/lessons/1-introduction
jupyter notebook
```

Use `Shift+Enter` or `Ctrl+Enter` to execute cells inside Jupyter Notebook
If you are using your own computer, make sure that you have python installed and you can pull git repositories.

#### Numerical Python (`numpy`)

**Feb. 21, 1:00 p.m.–3:00 p.m.**

#### Scientific Python (`scipy`)

**Feb. 28, 1:00 p.m.–3:00 p.m.**

#### Plotting (`matplotlib`)

**Mar. 7, 1:00 p.m.–3:00 p.m.**

#### Data Analytics (`pandas/scikit-learn`)

**Mar. 14, 1:00 p.m.–3:00 p.m.**

#### Data Analytics (`pandas/scikit-learn`)

**Mar. 28, 1:00 p.m.–3:00 p.m.**

#### Interactive Visualizaiton (`bookeh`)

**Apr. 4, 1:00 p.m.–3:00 p.m.**

#### Jupyter Notebook

**Apr. 11, 1:00 p.m.–3:00 p.m.**

#### Object Oriented Programming

**Apr. 18, 1:00 p.m.–3:00 p.m.**

#### Error handling (pdb, etc.)

**Apr. 25, 1:00 p.m.–3:00 p.m.**



After the break, look for topics including machine learning (`scikit-learn`), debugging and error handling, object-oriented programming, and more.
