## Python Workshops
##### [Computational Science and Engineering](http://cse.illinois.edu/)

### Foreword

Python is a popular scripting language which can support numerical computing, machine learning, , and more.  This workshop series will introduce you to basic and advanced Python modules and concepts.

The EWS Linux machines have everything we need for the workshop.  If you plan to use your personal laptop, you'll need to install a version of Python 3 like [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).


### Location

All workshops will be held in the EWS computer laboratory, [L520](http://ada.fs.illinois.edu/0210PLANB.html) [Digital Computer Laboratory](http://ada.fs.illinois.edu/0210.html).

**There is no sign-up for this series—walk-ins are welcome and encouraged!**

L520 DCL can be a little tricky to find if you haven't been there before. It's located in the basement, and can be accessed by going down the main staircase in DCL and turning right.
